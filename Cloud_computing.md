# Cloud computing:
- Cloud computing is a technology that enables users to access and utilize computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet, rather 
  than owning and maintaining physical hardware and software. It offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, allowing organizations and individuals to easily 
  scale their IT infrastructure.
